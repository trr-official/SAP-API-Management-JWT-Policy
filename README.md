# Introduction 

This repository contains a policy to call NW backend services from the internet using JWT as authorization tokens, and handling CSRF-TOKENS.

This policy takes alot of inspiration from  https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/02/part-1-modeling-the-jwt-token-verification-flows-in-sap-cloud-platform-api-management/ and  https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/19/part-2-single-sign-on-from-fiori-application-to-sap-gateway-via-sap-cloud-platform-api-management/ but have been extended with CSRF Token handling and most settings have been broken out into key vault settings. Please read and understand these two posts before setting up this policy.
